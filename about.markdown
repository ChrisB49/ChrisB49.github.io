![A picture of me]({{ site.url }}/profilePic.jpg){:style="margin: 10px auto 20px; display: block;" width="50%" height="50%"}

I am a 22 year old male who was born and raised in Grande Prairie, AB. 
Ive graduated from the GPRC Computer Systems Analyst Diploma program in 2017 with honors, and have since been working in IT. Currently I work for Avenge Energy Services as their in house IT Analyst.

I have a passion for Python 3 programming, and was the person my classmates would come to  if they had any issues with their python scripts / programs before going to the proffesor.
In my time at GPRC I discovered that I had a love for robotics and microcontrollers. My partner and I finished the robotics course with the highest grade in the class, and I directly attribute that success to the determination and drive we both had for robotics.

During my time in high school I took a particular liking to network administration, and pursued the Computer Networking Skills competition for two years. While working as the sole IT staff at Avenge Energy Services I have learned alot more about computer networking, and how API's rely on them to function. I believe that this is valuable knowledge that would help me most programming careers.
